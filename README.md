# SARimageColorization
This Repository contains my SAR image Colorization Model.

There are 2 Notebooks Located in this Repository in which one is based on Artificial Neural Network and the other is based on GAN Architecture actually i have made more than 20 changes in this project still figuring out new ideas that are logically and mathamatically satifies the target and requirement. Here the SARANN Files is fully MLP Based in which each image in training Data is considered as a just pixel intensities and also independent tensors which requires more emory and lot of space. and the other one is that is based on Image to image translation. which is regural gan. 

Also there are some images which are generated while training different architecture just for speculation purpose and the convergence progress of the Architecture.
